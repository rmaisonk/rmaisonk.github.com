    <h1>About Me</h1>


    <p>Hi! My name is Rose. I am a designer and animator. Currently I am working for a Marketing Company in Quincy. I was born and raised in Kenya, but moved to the US 3 years ago to do my masters, and somehow I'm still here 2 years after graduating. I did my masters in design and technology at Parsons, with emphasis on film and animation.I have dabbled with html and css before, but would love to get confident in my coding skills and learn more. I love tea!<br/>This website is really ugly! but hopefully after a few classes, I can make better ones!</p>
